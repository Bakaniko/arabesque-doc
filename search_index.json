This first version allows the exploration, filtering, geovisualization and representation of complex matrices. it provides a full toolset to filter you origin-destination data and simplify it in order to make clearer and understandable maps. Arabesque allows the creation of flow maps from a web browser - equipped with Mozilla or Chrome, from its own datasets. It is based on current technological possibilities, in particular those offered by the new web visualization (built in javascript and HTML 5) and mapping libraries (openlayers, d3, OSM, Turf, NaturalEarthData). Challenges The challenge of Arabesque consists in offering a set of tools for the analysis and tne cartographic representation of complex matrices (categorical and temporal). Its methodology is innovative : it articulates several dimensions of a matrix, interactivity and animation). Its techniques allow an easy exploration, a fluidity of the display in a simple configuration facilitating the appropriation of flow mapping by different audiences (academic, institutional, socio-economic, educational…). Contributors Contributors are: Scientific responsibility, design and coordination Françoise Bahoken, Etienne Côme and Laurent Jégou (coord.) Grégoire Le Campion, Marion Maisonobe, Alain Nguyen and Nicolas Roelandt Development &amp; Design Etienne Côme (coord.), Thomas Bapaume and Paul Fabre. Documentation Nicolas Roelandt (coord.), Françoise Bahoken General project and funding Logo du projet GFlowiz The geographic flow vizualisation (gflowiz) project Arabesque is part of the Gflowiz research project on flow maps in the geoweb. One of its goals is the web design of a geo visualization application for flow or traffic data to analyze the geographical determinants of spatial mobility. To this end, it aims to allow data describing geographical interactions to be explored and represented graphically, from different points of view, by focusing on statistical and geographical data filtering, spatial scale issues specific to certain data sets (the world scale or local scale) and their temporality. Funding The project is funded by former IFSTTAR’s scientific direction (VP Recherche Univ. Gustave Eiffel), with the participation of the Projet federateur Mobilities and numeric transitions (PF MobTransNum). The team is strengthened by the participation of members of CNRS laboratories, as well as it is supported by the research GDR Magis through the GEOWEB prospective action (2019).
