# Interface

Loading data into Arabesque leads to the creation of a default map, which is placed in the center of the view.


# Default flow mapping

Only the 10% most important links (in value) are represented and symbolized (see the automatic legend) according to their intensity (the flow variable entered at import).
The corresponding nodes are symbolized according to their degree (variable calculated automatically during the import).

By default, the links are represented in shades of blue and the nodes in red. The map is presented in the WGS84 projection, according to the lat/lon coordinates* declared during the import.

Except in the case of loading a projected geometry as input, the map is presented in WGS84.


## Interface

The interface of Arabesque is composed of the central view - which displays the map - and two side panels.

The left panel is for dealing with the geography/geometry layers.

The right panel is for playing with the flow data set.
