This first version allows the exploration, filtering, geovisualization and representation of complex matrices. it provides a full toolset to filter you origin-destination data and simplify it in order to make clearer and understandable maps. Arabesque allows the creation of flow maps from a web browser - equipped with Mozilla or Chrome, from its own datasets. It is based on current technological possibilities, in particular those offered by the new web visualization (built in javascript and HTML 5) and mapping libraries (OpenLayers, D3.js, Turf, OpenStreetMap and Natural Earth data). Challenges The challenge of Arabesque consists in offering a set of tools for the analysis and the cartographic representation of complex matrices (categorical and temporal). Its methodology is innovative : it articulates several dimensions of a matrix, interactivity and animation. Its techniques allow an easy exploration, a fluidity of the display in a simple configuration facilitating the appropriation of flow mapping by different audiences (academic, institutional, socio-economic, educational…). Contributors Contributors are: Scientific responsibility, design and coordination Françoise Bahoken, Etienne Côme and Laurent Jégou (coord.) Grégoire Le Campion, Marion Maisonobe, Alain Nguyen and Nicolas Roelandt Development &amp; Design Etienne Côme (coord.), Thomas Bapaume and Paul Fabre. Documentation Nicolas Roelandt (coord.), Françoise Bahoken General project and funding Logo du projet GFlowiz The geographic flow vizualisation (gflowiz) project Arabesque is part of the Gflowiz research project on flow maps in the geoweb. One of its goals is the web design of a geo visualization application for flow or traffic data to analyze the geographical determinants of spatial mobility. To this end, it aims to allow data describing geographical interactions to be explored and represented graphically, from different points of view, by focusing on statistical and geographical data filtering, spatial scale issues specific to certain data sets (the world scale or local scale) and their temporality. Funding The project is funded by former IFSTTAR’s scientific direction (VP Recherche Univ. Gustave Eiffel), with the participation of the Projet federateur Mobilities and numeric transitions (PF MobTransNum). The team is strengthened by the participation of members of CNRS laboratories, as well as it is supported by the research GDR Magis through the GEOWEB prospective action (2019).

These files come from RIcardo, a research project on historical international trade flows, observed from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution to the World War II. The project combines a historical trade flows database covering all countries of the world, see: github/medialab/ricardo_data with a website that offers to explore the history of international trade flows through visualizations, see: medialab/ricardo. In order to produce the first cartographic / geovisualizations of this historical corpus describing trade flows, a dataset has been prepared by Paul Girard (Medialab, Sciences Po) and Béatrice Dedinger (Centre d’Histoire, Sciences Po) for collective handling and exploitation during the GEOWEB-gflowiz worshop organized during the SAGEO2019 conference (More information: geoweb-gflowiz-Sageo. A version of this tutorial is available in French here: Une version française de ce tutoriel est disponible ici: github/gflowiz/sageo-ricardo The files used are available in this repository have the following structure: SAGEO_RICardo_nodes.csv: geographical location of entities files id (identifier of the geographical entity) name (name of the geographical entity) type (entity type : country, city, …) continent (continent) lat (latitude) long (longitude) SAGEO_RICardo_edges_small.csv : aggregated historical trade flows (to reduce the size of the dataset) idorigin (identifier of the entity of origin of the flow) iddestination (identifier of the destination entity of the flow) volume (financial volume of the flow in pounds sterling) decennie (decade concerned by the flow) SAGEO_RICardo_edges_nona.csv : non-aggregated historical trade flows idorigin (identifier of the entity of origin of the flow) iddestination (identifier of the destination entity of the flow) volume (financial volume of the flow in pounds sterling) annee (year of the exchange) periode (period of the exchange) decennie (decade of exchange) Arabesque also allows you to import your own flow data sets, in the form of an origin-destination matrix (adjacency list format in CSV), explore and filter them to create a readable flow map, in accordance with the principles of cartographic semiology. 1.2 Links (edges) data Arabesque requires the loading of at least one stream data set: a link file in CSV (separator: comma) and long format. You must also declare the 3 minimum fields required for flow mapping: those corresponding to the origin locations, to the destination locations and the flow values. If the OD matrix is temporal or available for different categories, you must also choose an aggregation method. On the homepage of(Arabesque), load at least one set of flow data.
