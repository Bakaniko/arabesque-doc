The creation of a flow map with Arabesque can be broken down into the following main steps:

1. Importing flow datasets (links and/or nodes)
**2. Processing flow datasets (creation of indicators, statistics)**
3. Statistical data computing (filtering, ...)
4. Geographical data computing (choosing the map background...)
5. Graphic symbolization for thematic flow mapping purposes
6. Flowmap decoration 
7. Export


## Data importation

### Links (*edges*) dataset importation

Arabesque requires the loading of at least one stream data set: a link file in CSV (separator: comma) and long format. 

You must also declare the 3 minimum fields required for flow mapping: those corresponding to the origin locations, to  the destination locations and the flow values. 

If the OD matrix is temporal or available for different categories, you must also choose an aggregation method.

On the homepage of([Arabesque](http://arabesque.ifsttar.fr/)), load at least one set of flow data.

**Application**

Statistical dataset

Loading data *SAGEO_RICardo_edges_small.csv*.

![](images/GjzU9IE.png)

The data must be in long format, with at least 3 columns  : origin, destination, flow

The data must be in long format, with at least 3 columns to identify the origin, destination and volume of flows.

If the flow data are multiscalar (e.g. flows that concern several social groups, several goods transported or that occur on several dates), it is necessary to aggregate them when loading them into Arabesque.

Several aggregation functions are available (sum, average, median, maximum, minimum) to simplify the flows.

Note: This aggregation does not interfere with the geo-visualization possibilities that will remain available for all existing types.


### Nodes (*vertex*) dataset importation

If you have locational data associated with your ODs, you can load the corresponding node files with "Import Location",
otherwise you can use predefined locations with "Preset Location".

If you select "Import Location", you must load a .GEOJSON or .CSV file, then choose the ID of the nodes and their lat/long geographic coordinates.

**Application**

Loading _SAGEO_RICardo_nodes.csv_ data

![](images/import_nodes.png)

The data must be in long format, with at least 3 columns to identify the place and the latitude (Y) and longitude (X) coordinates.

If you do not have a file for the geometry, you can use the codes identifying the reference data (e.g. INSEE codes of the French communes, ISO codes of the countries), to automatically geolocate your nodes. See Preset.

### Preset nodes dataset

Example of pre-selection of French municipalities.

After loading the link and node files, Arabesque automatically performs a join of the common attributes between the two files.


### Checking missing nodes/links features

Links that do not have an origin and/or destination ID are automatically deleted. Nodes that don't have an ID code that allows them to be geographically located are also not kept.

The list of deleted nodes and links is displayed in a new window.

![](images/import_suppr_entities.png)

This list is for quick reference only. You must copy and paste it (into a text file, for example) if you want to keep the list of deleted entities : here 77 nodes have been deleted because they are not related to other nodes. The corresponding nodes ID are list.

Loading data into Arabesque leads to the creation of a default map, which is placed in the center of the interface.

## Data indicators pre processing

The datasets are automatically modified when imported. Arabesque computes different indicators, which are available in a list that can be downloaded in . csv format (see Export and Save sections).

*Indicators on links*: Euclidean distance between the origin and destination entities

*Indicators on nodes* : see below the additional indicators () automatically calculated on the nodes of the RIcardo data


See below the indicators that have been automatically computed on the nodes of the RIcardo data.

## Visualize a default flow map

Loading data in Arabesque leads to the creation of a default map.

By default, the links are represented in shades of blue and the nodes in red. The map is presented in the WGS84 projection, according to the lat/lon coordinates* declared during the import.

Except in the case of loading a projected geometry as input, the map is presented in WGS84.

Hereby is the Ricardo's dataset default map with global statistic of the percent of links versus the percent of volume of flows and nodes.

![](images/defaut_flowmap.png)
Only the 10% most important links (in value) are represented and symbolized (see the automatic legend) according to their intensity (the flow variable entered at import).
The corresponding nodes are symbolized according to their degree (variable calculated automatically during the import).
