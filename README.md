This book contains the general documentation of [Arabesque](http://arabesque.ifsttar.fr/), a web application for exploration and thematic flow mapping.

_Arabesque_ presents different possibilities for action on geographical, statistical and 
cartographic information for cartographic purposes.

_Arabesque_ is a part of the GFlowiz (geographic flow visualisation) project, 
an interdisciplinary collaboration carried out with the objective of designing 
and developing a new web application dedicated to the geo visualization of flow 
and spatial networks datasets. 

For more information about _GFlowiz_, see (in French) : [geoflowiz.hypotheses](https://geoflowiz.hypotheses.org/)
