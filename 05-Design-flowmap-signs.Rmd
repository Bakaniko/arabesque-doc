# Design of the flowmap signs (nodes/links)

This section is about changing the semiology (design/style) and changing the geometry (size, ...) of flowmap signs: nodes and links.

Several types of actions can be performed on all the layer level available in the layer management section, using the following icon-buttons.


## Types of action on a layer

![](images/Buton_action_visible.png)

Visible/invisible the layer.


![](images/Buton_action_semio.png) 
Semiology parameters for nodes and links: color, size, text, opacity.


![](images/Buton_action_geom.png) 

Geometry parameters for changing links/arrows shape only (not available for nodes): orientation, type of link (curve, triange, ...) and arrow head parameters.


![](images/Buton_action_delete.png) 

Definitively deletes the layer.


## Designing the nodes

Drawing the nodes opens a window that allows you to act on their parameters related to semiology, respecting the Jacques Bertin' (1967) principes. 

### Semiology paramaters

Hereby the general window.

#### The color of nodes

![](images/geom_add_nodes_1.png)

The color of the nodes can be fixed (e.g. in black) or shaded in a range of tones.

![](images/choose_fixed_color.png)

The color of the nodes can be shaded in a range of tones.

![](images/geom_add_nodes_1_color.png)

The reference for the color schemes is Cynthia Brewer palette for Diverging, Multi Hue and Single Hue. See: [Color Brewer advices for maps](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3). An Extra Palette is also proposed in Arabesque.

The color of the node can be set according to one of the variables (initial or calculated by Arabesque) present in the dataset.

![](images/geom_add_nodes_1_color_variable.png)


By definition, the type of color range (Diverging/Multi Hue/Single Hue/Extra Palette) will have to be realized according to the type of the variable to represent (quantitative/qualitative, discrete/continuous, stock/ratio/scale, ...). 

![](images/geom_add_nodes_1_color_variable2.png)


The progression (up/down) of the **color range** depends on that of the **value range**: it can be direct or inverse. The checked box means an inverse progression: a light color is applied to a strong value.

#### **Size**
The size of the nodes can be fixed and the weight defined.

![](images/geom_add_nodes_2_size.png)


The size can be **weighted by a variable** according to one of the initial or additional **variables** available in the dataset (hereby the balance).


![](images/geom_add_nodes_2_size_variable.png)

Three functions to set the size of the node according to the corresponding value are proposed: the square, the square root and the logarithm.

![](images/geom_add_nodes_2_size_fct.png)

The **ratio** representing the max width in pixel of the graphic features can be defined - according to the map bounding box, to obtain an image with balanced features (neither too small nor too big).

![](images/geom_add_nodes_2_size_ratio.png)

#### **Text**
Textuals elements can also be added near the nodes.

![](images/geom_add_nodes_3_texte.png)

The text can be defined according to one of the variable available in the dataset.

![](images/geom_add_nodes_3_texte2.png)

The opacity of the text shade (currently set to black) can be set to a given value (here 0.85).


![](images/geom_add_nodes_3_texte_fixe.png)


The opacity of the text shade (currently set to black) can be varied according to an indicator present in the dataset.

## The nodes' geometric parameters

Not implemented yet.Upcoming projects.


## Designing the links



### Semiology parameters





### Change arrow shape 

Drawing the links opens a window that allows you to act on several dimensions of their geometry.
