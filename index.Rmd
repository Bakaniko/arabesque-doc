# About _Arabesque_ {-}

_Arabesque_ is a web application for thematic mapping of flow and spatial networks datasets.
This first version allows the exploration, filtering, geovisualization 
and representation of complex matrices. 
it provides a full toolset to filter you origin-destination data and 
simplify it in order to make clearer and understandable maps.

_Arabesque_ allows the creation of flow maps from a web browser - 
equipped with Mozilla or Chrome, from its own datasets.
It is based on current technological possibilities, in particular 
those offered by the new web visualization (built in javascript and HTML 5) 
and mapping libraries ([OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/), [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [Turf](https://turfjs.org/), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) data). 

## Challenges {-}

The challenge of _Arabesque_ consists in offering a set of tools for 
the analysis and the cartographic representation of complex matrices 
(categorical and temporal). Its methodology is innovative : 
it articulates several dimensions of a matrix, interactivity and animation.

Its techniques allow an easy exploration, a fluidity of the display 
in a simple configuration facilitating the appropriation of flow mapping 
by different audiences (academic, institutional, socio-economic, educational...).

## General project and funding {-}

### The geographic flow vizualisation (gflowiz) project {-}

Arabesque is part of the [Gflowiz  research project](https://geoflowiz.hypotheses.org/) on flow maps in the geoweb.
One of its goals is the web design of a geo visualization application for flow
or traffic data to analyze the geographical determinants of spatial mobility. 
To this end, it aims to allow data describing geographical interactions to be explored and represented graphically, from different points of view, 
by focusing on statistical and geographical data filtering, 
spatial scale issues specific to certain data sets 
(the world scale or local scale) and their temporality.

### Funding {-}

The project is funded by former IFSTTAR's scientific direction 
(VP Recherche Univ. Gustave Eiffel), with the participation of the 
Projet federateur Mobilities and numeric transitions (PF MobTransNum). 
The team is strengthened by the participation of members of CNRS laboratories,
as well as it is  supported by the research GDR Magis through the GEOWEB
prospective action (2019).
