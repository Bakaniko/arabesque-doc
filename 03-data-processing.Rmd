# Data processing

After loading the data, the creation of a flow map with Arabesque can be broken down into the following main steps:

1. Importing flow datasets (links and/or nodes)
**2. Processing flow datasets (creation of indicators, statistics)**
3. Geographical data computing : designing the map background (layers, ...)
4. Cartographic symbolization : designing the flowmap signs (arrows, ...)
5. Statistical data computing (filtering, ...)
7. Export

The links and nodes datasets are automatically modified when importing and _Arabesque_ computes different indicators.

## Data indicators pre processing

*Indicators on links*: Euclidean distance between the origin and destination entities

*Indicators on nodes* : see below the additional indicators () automatically calculated on the nodes of the RIcardo data

See below the indicators that have been automatically computed (ie the additional variable) on the nodes of the RIcardo data.

These indicators can be downloaded in . csv format (see Export and Save sections). 

Loading links and nodes data into _Arabesque_ leads to the creation of a default map, which is placed in the center of the interface.


## Visualize a default flow map

Loading data in Arabesque leads to the creation of a default map to avoid visualizing a "spaghetti effect" when entering the application ; all the defined parameters can then be modified during the exploration.

By default, the links are represented in shades of blue and the nodes in red. The map is presented in the WGS84 projection, according to the lat/lon coordinates* declared during the import.

Except in the case of loading a projected geometry as input, the map is presented in WGS84.

Hereby is the Ricardo's dataset default map with global statistic of the percent of links versus the percent of volume of flows and nodes.

Only the 10% most important links (in value) are represented and symbolized (see the automatic legend) according to their intensity (the flow variable entered at import).
The corresponding nodes are symbolized according to their degree (variable calculated automatically during the import).
