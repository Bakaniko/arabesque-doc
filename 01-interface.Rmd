# Interface {#interface}

The different steps of the creation/exploration/geovisualization of a flowmap are accessible through the interface of Arabesque.


>1. Importing flow datasets (links and/or nodes)
>2. Processing flow datasets (indicators calculation, ...)
>3. **Geographical data computing : designing the map background (layers, ...)**
>4. **Cartographic symbolization : designing the flowmap signs (arrows, ...)**
>5. **Statistical data computing (filtering, ...)**
>7. **Export**


**The general structure of the interface** is composed of three panels.
A **central panel** that contains the map - centered in France here.
And two side panels that allow interaction with the map :

- The **left panel** deals with geometries and geographical layers. Here for example with the [Voyager CARTO Basemap](https://carto.com/blog/new-voyager-basemap/) as basemap.

- The **right panel** contains tools to interact with the flow data set.

## Central panel

The central part of Arabesque corresponds to the **map view**. It results from the choice of the layers to be displayed (from the left panel) and the filtered values of the links and nodes (from the right panel).

This central panel also presents different buttons allowing the implementation of primary actions.

### Primary actions with buttons

The white page of Arabesque is decorated with blue action buttons.

![Details of the different buttons available in the central panel](images/central_panel_clear.png)


![](images/Buton_in_out.png) Zoom in/out - the same way as with the mouse wheel.

![](images/Buton_sauv.png) Save the project in .ZIP file for later use.

![](images/Buton_export.png) Export the map in .PNG including legends and and contributors' sources for external backgrounds such as OSM or NaturalEarth data.

![](images/Buton_center.png) Refocus and display the entire view without zooming in/out or panning.

![](images/Buton_export.png) Export the filtered flow data - the ones visible on the map - as a list file in .JSON format.

![](images/Buton_leg.png) Show/hide the legend.

![](images/Buton_screen_black.png) Switch to full screen display - with black background.

![](images/Buton_open_panel.png) Open/close the panels located on each side of the map.


### Primary legend

A legend is automatically generated for each map for nodes and links plot.

![Map legend](images/center_legend.png)

The symbolization elements (size, color and opacity) of the nodes and links are included. 
In default map of this example, the volume of flows and the degree of places are represented.


## Geographical panel

The left panel provides tools to **design the map**:

- define the background with the geographical or geometrical layers;

- customize the _design_/style of the nodes and links features.

The management of geographic information is composed of the home button and two sub-sections.

![General geographic information management panel](images/geom_panel.png)

### Home button {-}

![Home button](images/Buton_home.png) Return to the [home page](arabesque.ifsttar.fr) to start a new view.


### Background elements {-}

Those elements changes the background of the map :

- change projection of the current map ;
- add a title;
- add new layers. 

See the [Design map background](#background-design) section for more details.


### Geographical layer manager {-}

In practice, a map is composed by several layer such as bounding boxes, graticules, administrative divisions, etc.

The geographical layer manager section also allows you to organize the layers.

You can have as many layers you want but the *node* and *link* layers are unique and are loaded at the start of the application.

#### Layers controls {-}

Depending on the type of the layers, you can access several tools to customize them.

_Arabesque_ provides a large amount of styling options for the signes, please see the [Design flowmap signs](#sign-design) section for more details on that subject.


#### Flowmap Layers  {-}

All the map layers (from the [RIcardo example](#ricardo)) can be loaded using the `Add Layers` button. 

They appear in the layer manager sub-panel, one above the other as shown below.

![](images/RICardo_Design_signs_layers.png)

All present layers are available on the map - but not necessarily all of them are visible.

The order of the layers affects their visibility.
The top layer will be visible in the foreground.

In order to change the visibility of a layer, you can rearrange its position.


### Layer rearrangement {-}

The drawing of the different layers and their objects can be finely parameterized in _Arabesque_.
The possible complexity of the information (_density of the matrix_) might require a particular management of the superimpositions and arrangements of the links and nodes layers.

In the example below, the largest links are placed in the foreground by default, while the largest circles are not. After their rearrangement, the largest links are background and their color intensity has been changed (See Chapter [Designing flowmap signs](#sign-design)).

![_EXAMPLE:_ rearrangement of nodes and links](images/Dispositions.png)


The position of the layers above and below (foreground/lowerground) can be modified with a drag and drop.


![](images/RIcardo_layout_dragdrop.png)


_**Do it yourself!**_: 

-- Click on the link layer and hold it down;

-- Drag/drop the link layer and place it in the foreground;

-- Release the layer;

-- Repeat the same operation with the node layer if necessary.


After that, it can be seen that the flow layer has just been brought to the forefront.


## Statistical panel

The **right panel** is for filtering the flow data set, nodes and links.
This filtering influences the **display of the map**.

You can have several filters by data type (node or link).
An icon indicates which one is affected by the filter :

* ![](images/icon_links_filtering.png) Links/flows filter


* ![](images/icon_nodes_filtering.png) Nodes filter

Please see the [Filtering flow data](#filtering) section for more details on that subject.
